        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>¾ cup warm water, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Mix together 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup warm water, yeast, and 1 teaspoon
                 sugar in a large bowl. Allow to sit for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix in remaining 1 ½ cups flour, remaining 1/2 cup warm water, 
                2 tablespoons sugar, vegetable oil, and salt. Knead until dough is 
                smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a greased bowl, roll to coat with oil, and let sit until 
                tripled in size, 2 ½ to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Punch down dough and spread out on a floured board. Sprinkle baking 
                powder evenly on surface of dough; knead for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half; set aside one half in a covered bowl. Divide 
                remaining half into 12 equal pieces.</li>
            <li>Shape each into a ball; transfer each ball to a small square of waxed 
                paper with the smooth surface facing up. Repeat portioning and shaping 
                with remaining dough half. Cover all 24 dough balls and let sit until 
                doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Bring some water to a boil in a wok, then reduce heat to medium and keep 
                water at a low boil. Place the steam plate on a small wire rack in the 
                middle of the wok, leaving at least 2 inches of space between the plate 
                and the wok. Working in batches, place buns on waxed paper squares onto 
                the steam plate, leaving 1 to 2 inches between buns.</li>
            <li>Cover and steam buns for 15 minutes. Carefully remove the lid, so condensation 
                doesn't drip onto buns. Continue steaming remaining buns until all are cooked.</li>
        </ol>
